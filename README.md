# Note
- I would like to hear your thoughts on the mod
- Also I'm a beginner and this is my very first mod, so it is no good compared to other mods
- And I'm a game developer too. You can check out my games at https://epichorrors.itch.io/

# Dev
- Sometimes I will give early access code of the next version so keep that in mind
